# stage-10-memory

**Outcome.** A fresh gremlin ships with scribble vendored as its memory protocol. Distillation is a deliberate act, not an automatic flow. Findings are the workbench; `context/` remains the broadcast; promotion is by symlink.

**Scribble-side children are fleshed out (`s47a`–`s47e`).** They must ship before gremlin integration begins. Gremlin-side children remain suggestions — each needs its own `instructions.md` written and committed before being claimed.

## Strategy

**Two surfaces.**

- `.gremlin/.scribble/findings/` is the workbench — what the agent has distilled. Not always loaded.
- `.gremlin/context/` is the broadcast — what the agent always carries.
- Promotion is explicit: symlink `context/<id>.md → ../.scribble/findings/<id>/finding.md`. The agent decides when a finding has earned always-loading.

**Distillation is deliberate.**

- `/new` does **not** auto-pipe transcripts into `.scribble/in/`. The transcript graveyard is `transcript-archive/`, which is human-readable and already exists.
- A `dream` skill, triggered explicitly ("dream", "let's dream", "consolidate findings"), reads `transcript.md` (or a named archive) and decides what to ingest as small distilled notes.
- The agent participates in distillation rather than the system shovelling raw ore.
- Dreaming may also be invoked by a scheduled groundhog item that lands in `.nest/in/` and is tended via the same `dream` skill (no second code path). The dream item ships paused, so a fresh gremlin only dreams when the user opts in.

**Scribble stays pure markdown.**

- No YAML, no frontmatter. `finding.md` is plain markdown with a fixed set of optional H2 sections (`Claim`, `Why`, `Scope`, `Triggers`, `Associations`).
- `index` and `fetch` parse those sections directly. The contract is the heading shape.

**Memory integration is orthogonal to the tender hot path.** The integration rides on the existing always-loaded `context/` slot plus one new triggered skill plus the vendored scribble. `tend-loop.sh`, `llm.sh`, `tick-loop.sh`, and `archive.sh` need no memory-specific changes — even after the recent system-turn / per-item `.model` / `run.sh` dispatch / pidfile work, those scripts remain content-opaque to memory.

## Surgical changes

### gremlin

1. Vendor `.gremlin/.scribble/` with `scribble.sh`, `README.md`, default `dream.md`. Match the nestlings/groundhog vendoring pattern.
2. `init.sh`: one line to run `scribble.sh init` against the new copy after `cp -r`.
3. `skills/dream.md`: triggered skill. Tight triggers. Body: read raw, read findings, prefer associate→revise→create→drop, ingest *small distilled notes*, document promotion-via-symlink.
4. (Optional) one-line nudge in `commands/new.sh`. Defer until acceptance.

### scribble

Tracked in scribble's loom — see `~/repos/scribble/.loom/threads/plain-md-finding-protocol/`.

## Verification gate

Cold-start recall:

1. Fresh init produces an empty scribble.
2. Establish a durable preference in conversation.
3. Trigger dreaming → finding lands in `.scribble/findings/<id>/finding.md`.
4. Promote via symlink into `context/`.
5. `/new` rotates the transcript.
6. Ask the same question cold (no transcript context). Answer should still be correct *because* the symlinked finding is in the loaded context. **Load-bearing test.**
7. Drop test: trigger removal. Finding moves to `.scribble/dropped/`. Dangling symlink is acceptable; cleanup is a hygiene step the skill should mention.

If step 6 works, it's memory. If not, it's a filing cabinet.

## Child stitches

Scribble-side work has its own home now: `~/repos/scribble/.loom/threads/plain-md-finding-protocol/` (goal stitch with `s47a`–`s47e` children). Tracked there, not here. The gremlin-side children below all wait on that goal being tied.

Gremlin-side (suggestions — need their own `instructions.md` before being claimed):

- `s48-vendor-scribble` — copy scribble.sh + README into `.gremlin/.scribble/`, ship a default `dream.md`.
- `s49-init-wires-scribble` — `init.sh` runs scribble's init for new gremlins.
- `s50-dream-skill` — `skills/dream.md` with tight triggers + the procedure; consumes `INDEX`/`fetch`/`capture`.
- `s51-dream-schedule-paused` — ship a paused groundhog item that fires a dream instruction into `.nest/in/`. Depends on the groundhog "paused item" feature (see Dependencies).
- `s52-update-excludes` — extend `commands/update.sh` `excludes=(...)` list to preserve scribble runtime state across `/update` (likely `.scribble/in/`, `.scribble/findings/`, `.scribble/dropped/`, and `dream.md` if user-tunable). The DEVELOPING.md sync-helper template referenced in earlier drafts no longer exists; `/update` is the modern overlay path and the excludes list is the modern preserve surface.
- `s53-acceptance-memory` — the cold-start recall gate.

## Dependencies

- **Scribble plain-md finding protocol** *(scribble repo)*. Goal stitch at `~/repos/scribble/.loom/threads/plain-md-finding-protocol/`. Children `s47a`–`s47e` cover finding shape, `index`, `fetch`, `capture`, README. `s48`–`s50` here wait on it.
- ~~**Groundhog paused-items feature** *(groundhog repo)*. Stitch at `~/repos/groundhog/.loom/threads/paused-items/`. The dream item must ship paused so a fresh install does not auto-dream. `s51-dream-schedule-paused` waits on it.~~ ✅ Landed 2026-05-09 — `.paused` suffix on any path component takes that subtree off-schedule (cascades). Vendored into `.gremlin/.groundhog/`. `s51-dream-schedule-paused` is unblocked from the groundhog side.

## Decisions deferred to those child stitches

- Exact `dream.md` skill body (procedure, error cases, promotion guidance).
- Default `dream.md` shipped inside `.gremlin/.scribble/` — scribble's default vs gremlin-tuned.
- Trigger phrasing — start tight, loosen if needed.
- Whether `commands/new.sh` actually gets the nudge.
- `.gitkeep` strategy for `.scribble/in/`, `findings/`, `dropped/` in the canonical.
- `commands/update.sh` excludes additions (probably mirror `context/` — `.scribble/in/`, `.scribble/findings/`, `.scribble/dropped/`, and `dream.md` if it's user-tunable).
